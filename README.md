Introduction to Statistical Learning by Gareth James et al.

In this Repo I have implemented approximately 90% of the code in R. It is useful for two reasons.

1) For those who don't want to type and directly dive into the code
2) As part of learning I have modified the original code with some minor **tweaks** .

- Tweaks like

a) Added comments for better understanding
b) Changed code where I thought it would be better to optimize ( ~2-3% of the time)
